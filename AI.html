<h1>My First AI Chat Bot</h1>

<p>
	<a href="https://supercodingninja.github.io/" target=”_blank”>"HELLO, WORLD!"</a> This is my first AI chat box.  I have developed dialogue prompts before- even multiple choice <a href="https://supercodingninja.github.io/WhoIsOutside/" target=”_blank”>game</a>- and I've even used API (Application Programming Interface), and I am familiar of integrating such tools and technologies as ChatGPT into a website; but I have never fully coded my very own Chat Bot until Mr. David Bragg, founder of <a href="https://frontendsimplified.com/" target=”_blank”>Frontend Simplified</a> shown me how; and I highly recommend his courses!
</p>

<p>
	So, without further ado, "Hello 👋🏿 My name is <a href="https://github.com/supercodingninja" target=”_blank”>Frederick</a>.  How can I help you today?"
